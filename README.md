# Machine Learning Projects
- Major Data science Projects

### Project 1(Air Quality Index Prediction)
- Getting html file of whether report using requests
- Plotted data by takiing avg of every hour in a day(Excluded Nan Values)
- Combined and cleaned data which was scrapped
- Feature Selection,Data Visualization,and applied Linear Models
- Applied Lasso Reg and Ridge Reg(Ridge Regressor selected)
- Applied Decision tree using hyperparameter tunning(Better than Ridge regressor) 
- Applied Random forest regressor using hyperparameter tunning(Better than Decision tree regressor) 
- Applied Xgboost regressor using hyperparameter tunning(Not  Better than Random forest regressor) 
- So Random forest is best model till now
- Ann applied but still random forest is best model of them
- Model Deployed on heroku using flask
